    This project was done as part of my Bachelor thesis during spring 2022, in
    order to help provide a secondary backend to the SINTEF-developed MATLAB
    module MRST, and its submodule UPR. For more information about MRST, see

    Args:
        cell_dimensions (float): Base dimensions of each cell.

        shape (Iterable[float] | Iterable[Iterable[float]] | dict[str, float]):
            Size or shape of the domain.
            Legal forms:
                Iterable[float]: Shape = (xmax, ymax), and is the size of a 
                    domain starting at (0, 0). Shape must have length 2.
                    Examples:
                        >>> shape = [1, 1]
                        >>> shape = (9001, 14)
                Iterable[Iterable[float]]: Shape is a list of points making up
                    the domain. All points in shape must be ordered either
                    clockwise or counterclockwise, and all points in shape must
                    have length >= 2 (only the first 2 elements are used).
                    Examples:
                        >>> shape = [
                            (0, 0), (0.5, 0.2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)
                        ]
                        >>> shape = [
                            (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)
                        ]
                dict[str, float]: Primarily used when complex domains are used
                    in MATLAB. dict must have keys "x" and "y", where the 
                    corresponding list being the x- and y-coordinates of the
                    complex domain.
                    Examples:
                        >>> shape = {
                                "x": [0, 0.5, 1, 1, 0],
                                "y": [0, 0.2, 0, 1, 1]
                            }
                        >>> shape = {"x": [0, 1, 1, 0], "y": [0, 0, 1, 1]}
            NOTE: Any constraints must be wholly within the supplied domain!

        face_constraints (list[Iterable] | dict[str, float] | dict[str, Iterable]
                | dict[str, dict[str, float]] | dict[str, dict[str, Iterable]],
                optional):
            Constraints for the cell faces. Each constraint is the coordinate
            of a surface-trace. The surface is assumed to be linear between 
            the coordinates. The resulting mesh will place sites such that 
            the surfaces are traced by faces of the grid.
            Legal forms:
                list[list[Iterable]]: Primarily used when calling the function
                    from Python. Each element of face constraint is a list of
                    point(s) along the constraint. Note that each element must
                    be a list of points, even if there is only one point!
                    Examples:
                        >>> face_constraints = [
                                [(0.1, 0.1), (0.9, 0.9)],
                                [(0.2, 0.8), (0.5, 0.5), (0.8, 0.2)]
                            ]
                        >>> face_constraints = [
                                [(0.5, 0.5)],
                                [(0.1, 0.1), (0.9, 0.9)]
                            ]
                dict[str, float] | dict[str, list]: Used for only one
                    constraint line, primarily when the function is called
                    from MATLAB. face_constraints must contain the keys "x" and
                    "y", with the corresponding float or list being the x- and
                    y-coordinates of point(s) along the constraint.
                    Examples:
                        >>> face_constraints = {"x": [0.1, 0.9], "y": [0.1, 0.9]}
                        >>> face_constraints = {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5}
                dict[Any, dict[str, float]] | dict[Any, dict[str, Iterable]]:
                    Used for more than one constraint line, primarily when the
                    function is called from MATLAB. Each element in
                    face_constraints.values() must contain keys "x" and "y",
                    with the corresponding float or list being the x- and y-
                    coordinates of point(s) along the constraint. It does not
                    matter what is used as keys for the top-level dictionary.
                    Examples:
                        >>> face_constraints = {
                            "line": {"x": [0.1, 0.9], "y": [0.1, 0.9]},
                            "point": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5},
                            "keys dont matter": {"x": 0.1, "y": 0.9}.
                            2022: {"x": 0.9, "y": 0.1}
                        }
            NOTE: Any constraints must be wholly within the supplied domain!
            If None, face_constraints will be an empty list. Defaults to None.

        face_constraint_factor (float, optional): The size of the cells close
            to the face constraints, as compared to supplied cell_dimensions.
            Cells within min_threshold_distance will have size
            face_constraint_factor * cell_dimensions. Equivalent to FCFactor in
            MRST/UPR/pebiGrid2D. Defaults to 1/3.

        min_threshold_distance (float, optional): Distance from face constraints
            where cell dimensions will start increasing. Defaults to 0.05.

        max_threshold_distance (float, optional): Distance from face constraints
            where cell dimensions will be back to their default (max) value,
            i.e. the supplied argument cell_dimensions. Defaults to 0.2.

        face_intersection_factor (float, optional): The size of the cells close
            to intersections between face constraints, as compared to supplied
            cell_dimensions. Cells within min_intersection_distance from an 
            intersection will have size face_intersection_factor * cell_dimensions.
            If None, no extra cell shaping will occur around intersections.
            The factor is also used in "breaks" of lines, i.e. if there is a
            sharp "turn" in a line segment. Defaults to None.

        min_intersection_distance (float, optional): Distance from intersections
            where cell dimensions will start increasing. If None, will use
            min_threshold_distance. Defaults to None.

        max_intersection_distance (float, optional): Distance from intersections
            where cell dimensions will be back to their default (max) value,
            i.e. the supplied argument cell_dimensions. If None, will use
            min_threshold_distance. Defaults to None.

        fracture_mesh_sampling (int, optional): The number of points along the
            face constraints should be sampled to calculate the threshold
            distances. Defaults to 100.

        cell_constraints (list[Iterable] | dict[str, float] | dict[str, Iterable]
                | dict[str, dict[str, float]] | dict[str, dict[str, Iterable]],
                optional):
            Constraints for the cell centroids. Each constraint is a line,
            which the method will attempt to place in the center of the returned
            grid. The lines are assumed to be linear between the coordinates.
            If a constraint is only one coordinate, the line is treated as a
            point constraint.
            Legal forms:
                list[list[Iterable]]: Primarily used when calling the function
                    from Python. Each element of cell constraint is a list of
                    point(s) along the constraint. Note that each element must
                    be a list of points, even if there is only one point!
                    Examples:
                        >>> cell_constraints = [
                                [(0.1, 0.1), (0.9, 0.9)],
                                [(0.2, 0.8), (0.5, 0.5), (0.8, 0.2)]
                            ]
                        >>> cell_constraints = [
                                [(0.5, 0.5)],
                                [(0.1, 0.1), (0.9, 0.9)]
                            ]
                dict[str, float] | dict[str, list]: Used for only one
                    constraint line, primarily when the function is called
                    from MATLAB. cell_constraints must contain the keys "x" and
                    "y", with the corresponding float or list being the x- and
                    y-coordinates of point(s) along the constraint.
                    Examples:
                        >>> cell_constraints = {"x": [0.1, 0.9], "y": [0.1, 0.9]}
                        >>> cell_constraints = {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5}
                dict[Any, dict[str, float]] | dict[Any, dict[str, Iterable]]:
                    Used for more than one constraint line, primarily when the
                    function is called from MATLAB. Each element in
                    cell_constraints.values() must contain keys "x" and "y",
                    with the corresponding float or list being the x- and y-
                    coordinates of point(s) along the constraint. It does not
                    matter what is used as keys for the top-level dictionary.
                    Examples:
                        >>> cell_constraints = {
                            "line": {"x": [0.1, 0.9], "y": [0.1, 0.9]},
                            "point": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5},
                            "keys dont matter": {"x": 0.1, "y": 0.9}.
                            2022: {"x": 0.9, "y": 0.1}
                        }
            NOTE: Any constraints must be wholly within the supplied domain!
            If None, cell_constraints will be an empty list. Defaults to None.

        cell_constraint_factor (float, optional): The size used for cells
            around cell constraints, as compared to supplied cell_dimensions.
            Equivalent to CCFactor in MRST/UPR/pebiGrid2D. Defaults to 1/4.

        cell_constraint_line_factor (float, optional): The size used for cells
            around cell constraint lines, as compared to the supplied
            cell_dimensions. Overrides cell_constraint_factor for lines. If
            set to None, cell_constraint_factor will be used for lines.
            Defaults to None.
            
        cell_constraint_point_factor (float, optional): The size used for cells
            around cell constraint points, as compared to the supplied
            cell_dimensions. Overrides cell_constraint_factor for points. If
            set to None, cell_constraint_factor will be used for points.
            Defaults to None.

        mesh_algorithm (str | int, optional): What meshing algorithm should be
            used. Can either be the Gmsh-given ID of the algorithm or a string:
                "MeshAdapt" = 1
                "Automatic" = 2
                "Delaunay" = 5
                "Frontal" = 6
                "BAMG" = 7
                "DelQuad" = 8
            Defaults to "Delaunay".

        recombination_algorithm (str | int, optional). What recombination
            algorithm should be used, and whether recombination should be done.
            Recombination makes Gmsh attempt to create a quadrangle mesh, rather
            than a triangle mesh. Can be either the Gmsh-given ID of the
            algorithm or a string:
                "Simple" = 0
                "Blossom" = 1
                "SimpleFull" = 2
                "BlossomFull" = 3
            If None, no recombination will be done.
            NOTE: Blossom is Gmsh default, but struggles with constraints. It
                may therefore be beneficial to use SimpleQuad, if there are
                constraints.
            NOTE 2: Recombination may lead to weird results for constraints,
                as the recombination is done after constraints have been applied.
                This is especially true for SimpleFull and BlossomFull, who
                automatically perform a coarser mesh, followed by recombination,
                smoothing and subdivision.
                
        savename (str, optional): Name of the saved file. If None, no file will
            be saved. The MATLAB functions assume that the file will be saved
            as "TEMP_Gmsh_MRST.m". Defaults to "TEMP_Gmsh_MRST.m".

        run_frontend (bool, optional): Set to True in order to run the Gmsh
            frontend and show the created mesh. Defaults to False.
